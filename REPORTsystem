First, go to [steamrep.com] and input the user's steamlink. (ex) http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxxgamingyt/
Second, find their steamID64 link from the info given in the box. (ex) http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072578191
  (This link will never change, even if they change their name. It's a solid base to start with for reporting.)

PLEASE take note of the user's hours on CounterStrike: Global Offensive. This is a big selling point to prove hacking as well,
  as many hackers buy fresh accounts from others to hack on so there is no real loss of money or time.

[Format]:

Current Name: Silence
Steamlink: http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxxgamingyt/
steamID64: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072578191

Reason: Suspected of Wall-Hacking. Proof can be shown in the screenshots/video provided.

PLEASE ALWAYS lead with "Suspected"! Even if there is no doubt in your mind, there may be some in others. If you say that they are
walling, and many others do not, then they may think you are false-reporting. False-reporting is a ban/report from the community. 
Make sure you have sufficient evidence against the suspect or you will be moved into a "Cried Wolf" kind of situation. We want to
  be a strong group of individuals that are better people than those hacking. Do NOT resort to calling others out within discussions.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, CONTACT Silence ON STEAM OR ASK WITHIN DISCUSSIONS. WE WILL BE GLAD TO HELP.

[All people who are reported, with the community agreeing if they're guilty, will be placed here under a case file containing
  their steamID64 and a reason why they were reported, so that other members of the community can be wary of them.]
